        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Graphics.BlendMode">
            <summary>
            Blending mode to be used for drawing. Usually in Opaque mode or Normal transparency.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:DeltaEngine.Graphics.BlendMode.Normal">
            <summary>
            Default blending mode is source alpha with inverted source alpha for the destination.
            Usually used for images with alpha, otherwise Opaque is choosen.
            </summary>

        <member name="F:DeltaEngine.Graphics.BlendMode.Opaque">
            <summary>
            Opaque is the fastest mode as it does not use any blending. Used for non alpha images.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:DeltaEngine.Graphics.BlendMode.AlphaTest">
            <summary>
            Same as opaque, but use AlphaTest to discard any pixel below 0.66f in the alpha channel.
            Rendering this is faster than Normal because we need no sorting and we can skip pixels.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:DeltaEngine.Graphics.BlendMode.Additive">
            <summary>
            Used to accumulate the color we already got, all pixels are added to the destination.
            Has the advantage that we do not need to sort, can be rendered in any order after Opaque.
            </summary>

        <member name="F:DeltaEngine.Graphics.BlendMode.Subtractive">
            <summary>
            Opposite of additive blending. Instead of always adding more brightness to the target screen
            pixels, this one subtracts brightness. Often used for fake shadowing effects (blob shadows).
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:DeltaEngine.Graphics.BlendMode.LightEffect">
            <summary>
            Special blend mode of DestColor+One used for light effects (similar to lightmap shaders, but
            just using a lightmap, no diffuse texture). Used for glow, light and flare effects.
            </summary>

        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Graphics.VertexPositionColorTextured">
            <summary>
            Vertex struct that describes 3D position, vertex color and texture coordinate.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Graphics.Drawing">
            <summary>
            Allows to draw shapes or images on screen. Needs a graphic device.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Graphics.Device">
            <summary>
            The graphics device clears everything (via Run) at the beginning of each frame and shows the
            result of the render buffer on screen at the end of each frame (via Present).
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Graphics.Image">
            <summary>
            Provides a way to load images. Use Drawing to show them on the screen.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Graphics.VerticesMode">
            <summary>
            Vertices are either presented as triangles (3 vertices are one polygon) or as pairs of lines.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Graphics.VertexPositionColor">
            <summary>
            Simplest vertex format with just 3D positions and vertex colors (12 + 4 bytes).
            </summary>
