            AssemblyChecker.IsAllowed is used whenever we have to check all loaded assemblies for types.
            Examples include BinaryDataExtensions and AutofacResolver.RegisterAllTypesFromAllAssemblies

            <summary>
            NCrunch will always execute all resolvers as it does not understand the Ignore, but only
            TestResolver will be executed (rest is ignored by default). ReSharper will ignore all test
            cases with Ignore (e.g. with F6), but you can still execute them manually if you like.

            <summary>
            By default all slow integration tests (using a non test resolver) are excluded from NCrunch
            runs. You can either temporary enable them all here or just selectivly in derived classes.

            Use this flag and comment out all .Ignore calls in the Resolvers list to test all Visual
            and Integration tests with one frame. Used to test approval tests with all resolvers to
            make sure everything is fully working (DX, XNA, GL). Warning, each test takes a few seconds.
